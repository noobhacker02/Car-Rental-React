# Car Rental App - Deployment Guide

## Pre-deployment Checklist

### 1. Dependencies
Make sure your `package.json` includes all required dependencies:
- `react: ^18.2.0`
- `react-dom: ^18.2.0`
- `lucide-react: ^0.263.1`

### 2. File Structure
Ensure your project structure matches:
```
src/
├── App.jsx
├── Homepage.jsx
├── CarCard.jsx
├── Homepage.css
├── index.css
├── main.jsx
└── Navbar_Components/
    ├── Navbar.jsx
    ├── DesktopNavbar.jsx
    ├── MobileNavbar.jsx
    ├── MobilePanels.jsx
    ├── MobileSidePanel.jsx
    ├── Categories.jsx
    ├── BrandsDropdown.jsx
    ├── PriceRangeDropdown.jsx
    └── SortByDropdown.jsx
public/
├── carlogo.png
└── index.html
```

### 3. Logo File
Place your logo file at `public/carlogo.png` - this path is referenced in:
- `DesktopNavbar.jsx`
- `MobileSidePanel.jsx`

## Netlify Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Drag & Drop (Easiest)
1. Run `npm run build` locally
2. Drag the generated `dist/` folder to netlify.com/drop
3. Your site will be deployed instantly

### Option 2: Git Integration (Recommended)
1. Push your code to GitHub/GitLab
2. Connect your repository in Netlify
3. Use these build settings:
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `dist`
   - **Node version**: `18.x`

### Option 3: Netlify CLI
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify build
netlify deploy --prod
```

## Configuration Files

The following configuration files have been provided:

### `netlify.toml`
```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "npm run build"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
```

### `vite.config.js`
```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  build: {
    outDir: 'dist',
    sourcemap: false,
    minify: 'terser'
  }
})
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build Errors
If you encounter build errors:
1. Delete `node_modules/` and `package-lock.json`
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run build`

### Missing Dependencies
If Lucide React icons don't load:
```bash
npm install lucide-react@^0.263.1
```

### Logo Not Loading
- Ensure `carlogo.png` exists in `public/` directory
- Check file name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Verify file is a valid image format

### Mobile Navigation Issues
- All mobile panels and side panels have been fixed
- No more styled-jsx dependencies
- All styles are in regular CSS

### Performance Optimization
The build is configured with:
- Code splitting for better loading
- Minification enabled
- Separate chunks for vendor libraries
- Optimized asset handling

## Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Environment Variables

If you need environment variables:
1. Add them in Netlify dashboard under "Site settings" > "Environment variables"
2. Access them in your code with `import.meta.env.VITE_YOUR_VAR_NAME`

## Post-deployment Testing

After deployment, test:
- [ ] Homepage loads correctly
- [ ] All car cards display properly
- [ ] Filtering system works (brands, price, sort, categories)
- [ ] Mobile navigation functions
- [ ] Image carousel works on car cards
- [ ] Responsive design on different screen sizes
- [ ] All interactive elements respond correctly

## Performance Monitoring

Monitor your deployed site:
- Lighthouse scores in browser dev tools
- Netlify Analytics in dashboard
- Core Web Vitals in Search Console

## Maintenance

Regular maintenance tasks:
- Update dependencies monthly
- Monitor build logs for warnings
- Test on new browser versions
- Optimize images as needed

Your car rental app should now deploy successfully on Netlify with all components working correctly!
